# NMAP

###### Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. Nmap is a basic tool for performing horizontal (network-wide) or vertical (host-specific) network scans

Basic with output, it will create a gnmap, nmap and xml file
```
	• nmap -v 192.168.152.0/24 -oA output
```

Stealth scanning (TCP SYN) starts the connection with a SYN but does not end it with ACK, it is fast and silent:
```
	• nmap -sS   192.168.152.0/24
```

Scanning useful for initial phase of discovering host, makes a ping to all the machines of the network announced. As it is only a ping it is quite stealthy:
```
	• nmap -v -sn 192.168.152.0/24
```

TCP connect scan, which is louder than the previous one, gives basic information:
```
	• nmap -v -sT  192.168.152.0/24
```

So you can try to know the operating system:
```
	• nmap -O 192.168.152.130
```

So to see the version of the devices, load 47 scripts to see the versions of the services:
```
	• nmap -sV 192.168.152.130
```

To view services, version, operating system, hostname and even try some anonymous access, load 147 scripts, (like -sV , -O, --traceroute y -sC):
```
	• nmap -A 192.168.152.130
```

Ping sweep:
```
	• nmap -sP 192.168.152.0/24
```

Noisy but brings out a lot of information: 
```
	• nmap -A -v -d -p- 192.168.152.130
	• nmap -A -v -d -p1-65535 192.168.152.130
```

To bypass the firewall by splitting the packets:
```
-f : 8 bytes
-f -f: 16 bytes
-mtu nª: por el numero que elija el usuario
```

These are the NSE which are collections of scripts each based on a different attack or recognition:
Check [Nmap Exploit list](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/exploit.html). 


```
	• nmap -v -sS -sV --script auth 192.168.152.130
	• nmap -v --script vuln 192.168.152.130
	• nmap -v -d -sV -p 53,80,139,445 --script dos 192.168.152.130
	• nmap -v -sV -p 21,22,23,80,2121,3306,3389 --script brute 192.168.152.130
	• nmap -v -d -p 21,80,139,445 --script exploit 192.168.152.130
```

My favourite scan that gives more information and a lot of noise is :

- -v            --> verbose
- -d            --> debbug
- -A            --> many scripts like -sV , -O, --traceroute and -sC
- -sS           --> TCP SYN scan
- -f -f         --> fragments 16byte packets into 16bytes to avoid the firewall
- -p-           --> for all ports (0 to 65535)
- --script vuln --> to remove vulnerabilities from typical services
- -oA           --> to make an output in xml for metasploit or in nmap or gnmap to see it graphically

```
	• nmap -v -d -A -sS -f -f -p- --script vuln 192.168.152.131 -oA output_file
```


# ZENMAP

###### Zenmap is the official Nmap Security Scanner GUI

We downloaded the npm package of zenmap on the web:
- Check [ZenMap official page](https://nmap.org/dist/zenmap-7.80-1.noarch.rpm). 

First, update the repositories:

```
	• apt-get update
```
We need to install alien, which is a Linux package converter program, to be able to use rpm packages: 

```
	• apt-get install alien
```

We use alien to transform the rpm package to deb:

```
	• alien zenmap-7.80-1.noarch.rpm
```

And we will install zenmap with dpkg:

```
	• alien zenmap-7.80-1.noarch.rpm
```

And zenmap starts smoothly, opening up a pop-up.. *This GUI will help us a lot to make the scans easier, but I recommend always to use the command line*


# ENUM4LINUX

###### Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems. Enum4linux is a script to make scans to linux machines, it gets a lot of information from them, an alternative to nmap. It is more focused on making null logins, on getting users, groups etc.. 
It is very easy to use and provides useful information. 

- Check [enum4linux official GitHub](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux). 

```
	• enum4linux 192.168.152.130
```



# NESSUS

###### Nessus is a software for scanning for vulnerabilities in various operating systems. Paid for but something can be done locally.

I download Nessus on his website, take care that it is compatible with his system and architecture:

- Check [Nessus Download Site](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true). 


I go to the downloads folder and with the dpkg command I install the Nessus package:

```
	• dpkg -i Nessus-8.9.1.debian6_amd64.deb
```
As the Nessus help when installing it tells me to execute the following command to start the Nessus daemon:

```
	• /etc/init.d/nessusd start
```

Check if the port is up, usually the port 8834:

```
	• netstat -antp
```

We can now access the Nessus web interface which will be mounted on port 8834. But we will need a license for Nessus Essential:

- Check "Need an Activation Code?" [Nessus Essentials](https://es-la.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials). 

We go back to our local Nessus and enter the Nessus registration key. We enter a username and password for the server and start downloading the pluggins


# WHATWEB

###### WhatWeb recognises web technologies including content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, statistic/analytics packages, JavaScript libraries, web servers, and embedded devices. It is a command line Wappalyzer, information about the versions of the technologies used, cookies, CMS...

- Check the official GitHub but is installed with Kali [WhatWeb Official GitHub](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb).

```
	• whatweb -v example.com
```

# DIRB

###### DIRB is a Web Content Scanner. It looks for existing and hidden Web Objects. It basically works by launching a dictionary-based attack against a web server and analyzing the response.

- Check DIRB [DIRB Kali tool](https://tools.kali.org/web-applications/dirb).

```
	• dirb https://example.com 
```

With the -w argument to list the directories that are automatically enumerated:

```
	• dirb https://example.com  -w
```

If I want you to use a particular list and I want you to save the results locally

```
	• dirb https://example.com  /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/vulns/apache.txt -o output.txt
```

If I want you to look for a specific extension

```
	• dirb https://example.com  -X .php
```

If I want you not to show me the pages that give a specific error:

```
	• dirb https://example.com   -N 302
```

If I want to put a delay of milliseconds to each request:

```
	• dirb https://example.com   -z 100
```


# WAFW00F

###### To see if the website has any security measures, firewall or WAF we can throw wafw00f

It is very easy to use and gives us a quick result:

```
	• wafw00f https://example.com 
```

# NIKTO

###### Nikto does a web analysis of possible vulnerabilities in the page, such as outdated server versions or programming language, or other frameworks. It is very noisy and very slow. If it is susceptible to XSS or SQL injections, it does a complete audit of the website. 

You can -h to specify the host, you can specify the port either 80 443 or 8080 or 8081:


- Check Nikto [Nikto Github](https://github.com/sullo/nikto)

```
	• nikto -h http://192.168.152.130:80
```

# OWASP ZAP

###### OWASP ZAP is an open source web security scanner. It has a very intuitive and easy to use GUI.

We downloaded it from:

- Download ZAP [ZAP Download](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/).

We have to give execute rights to the sh file and execute it, then we use it executing the sh file that leave us:

```
	• chmod 744 ZAP_2_9_0_unix.sh
	• ./ZAP_2_9_0_unix.sh
	• zap.sh
```

We will get a pop-up already with the program to use it, and we will give Automated Scan to put our target IP and PORT
