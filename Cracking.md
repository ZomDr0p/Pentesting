# HASHCAT
##### Hashcat is the world's fastest and most advanced password recovery tool.


## Windows - Dictionary Attack

To crack the Windows hashes we will take this example of a dumped hash from a Windows 2003 machine using HASHDUMP. Note that these hashes are in NTLM format so keep in mind that Hashcat has to use this module. 

NTLM hash in the format <User name>:<User ID>:<LM hash>:<NT hash>:<Comment>:<Home Dir>:

```

root@kali20203:/home/user/Desktop# cat windows2003_hashdump_ouput.txt
Administrador:500:e52cac67419a9a224a3b108f3fa6cb6d:8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c:::

```

We are going to execute the following command with these arguments in order to crack the passwords

- -m 1000 --> The type of module to be used in this case will be NTLM
- -a 0 --> dictionary  method, we have to point out the dictionary we are going to use
- -o output_crack.txt --> the output file of cracked NTLM hashes
- widnows2003hashes_full.txt --> Hash NTLM 
/usr/share/wordlists/personalizada.txt --> the dictionary used which will be words in plain text


```

root@kali20203:/home/user/Desktop# hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 -o output_windowsxpcrack.txt windowsxphashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/personalizada.txt

```
